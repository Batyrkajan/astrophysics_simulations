# CUDA Learning Plan - Computational Physics + Finance

## Who I Am
- Physics student (F1 visa)
- Already built N-body simulations (Verlet integration)
- Active trader, want to build tools for myself
- Target: Computational physics / HPC roles (not saturated quant)

## Goal
Build GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulation engine for:
- Market simulation
- Option pricing  
- Risk analysis
- Strategy backtesting

## Why This Project
- Same math as physics (stochastic processes, statistical mechanics)
- Useful for personal trading
- Interview-ready for: NVIDIA, national labs, fintech, aerospace
- Demonstrates: CUDA, numerical methods, domain knowledge

## Hardware
- NVIDIA RTX 5090
- Windows

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: CUDA Foundations (Week 1-2)
- GPU architecture (SMs, warps, memory hierarchy)
- Thread/block/grid model
- Memory types (global, shared, registers, constant)
- Write basic kernels: vector ops, reductions

### Phase 2: Monte Carlo on GPU (Week 3-4)
- Random number generation on GPU (cuRAND)
- Parallel Monte Carlo integration
- Geometric Brownian Motion simulation
- European option pricing

### Phase 3: Advanced Finance (Week 5-6)
- Correlated asset simulation (Cholesky decomposition on GPU)
- Path-dependent options (Asian, barrier)
- American options (Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm)
- Greeks calculation via finite difference

### Phase 4: Risk & Optimization (Week 7-8)
- Portfolio VaR calculation
- Expected shortfall
- Covariance matrix computation
- Strategy backtesting framework

### Phase 5: Polish & Performance (Week 9-10)
- Profiling with Nsight
- Memory optimization
- Multi-GPU support
- Python bindings for easy use

## Key Concepts to Master

### CUDA Specific
- Memory coalescing (why access patterns matter)
- Occupancy (keeping GPU cores busy)
- Bank conflicts in shared memory
- Warp divergence (why branches hurt)
- Streams and async execution

### Finance/Math Specific
- Geometric Brownian Motion: dS = μSdt + σSdW
- Ito's lemma
- Risk-neutral pricing
- Cholesky decomposition for correlations
- Variance reduction techniques

## Setup Instructions (Windows + RTX 5090)

1. Install CUDA Toolkit 12.x from NVIDIA
2. Install Visual Studio 2022 (Community, with C++ workload)
3. Verify: `nvcc --version` in terminal
4. Install Python packages: `pip install cupy numba pycuda`

## First Code to Write

Start with this - Monte Carlo Pi estimation on GPU:
- Simple enough to understand
- Shows the parallel pattern
- Same structure as option pricing

Then immediately move to GBM simulation - that's where it gets real.

## Resources
- CUDA C++ Programming Guide (NVIDIA docs)
- "Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering" - Glasserman
- Your existing physics intuition (this is just statistical mechanics)

## Interview Talking Points This Gives You
- "Achieved 500x speedup over NumPy for Monte Carlo simulation"
- "Implemented Cholesky decomposition on GPU for correlated assets"
- "Optimized memory access patterns reducing kernel time by 4x"
- "Built end-to-end risk analysis pipeline processing 10M scenarios in <1 second"
